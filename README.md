## Project Title

**Hello World Introduction**

## Background

I am originally from Waverly, Iowa and graduated from Waverly-Shell Rock High School in 2019. I have been a life long hawkeye fan so that is why I chose to go to the University of Iowa for college.

## Experience

I enjoy challenging myself and learning by doing. I have already had 3 internship experiences and also several on campus part time jobs which keep me busy to juggle all of that with my school work.

## Hobbies

Outside of school and work I really enjoy playing and watching sports, reading, being outside, and spending quality time with my family and friends.
